                My Three-Semester Time Capsule Essay

            <div id="intro">
                <p class="intro-text">
                    Our home is on the verge of mass destruction, and it’s all our fault. I recall learning from 
                    the last lecture of CPSG 101 last semester that we should still remain hopeful for our future! 
                    Moreover, within the lecture, it was stated that we as a species “must not give in to climate 
                    despair”. Prior to being a student within the Science and Global Change (SGC) program of 
                    College Park Scholars, I was aware of the inevitable threats to the planet. I was a proactive 
                    environmentalist prior to attending the University of Maryland, College Park: most of my work 
                    was on the research aspect and elimination of jargon into concise portions of media people 
                    can consume. And so now, in my third semester as a SGC scholar, I understand that the acts 
                    I’ve done in the past are perfect examples of ways in which we may plan for resilience in 
                    a future of global change — but also more. In my astronomy class, we covered the greenhouse 
                    effect and global warming. And throughout my computer science courses, I’ve recognized the 
                    potential and current impact of computing technology on global change. As an SGC student, 
                    I’ve learned that there are ways in which things are interconnected and can work in unison. 
                </p>
                <p class="intro-text">
                    Within the SGC program, I was able to observe a myriad of topics instead of only being able 
                    to explore the world of global warming and climate change through a microscopic lens as I 
                    had before. One of the most incredible activities that I had the opportunity to partake in 
                    was from last semester. The class was divided into four groups, with each group being 
                    assigned a likely possibility for our future: Greentocracy, Post Anthropocene, Extinction 
                    Express, and Humans Inc. And with such, I was moved. I then presented my delegated scenario, 
                    the Post-Anthropocene, to my fellow group members, and they were equally as moved too!  
                </p>
            
                <p class="intro-text">
                    I’ve been using an iPad to take notes in college for the past three semesters now. Its 
                    usage peaks for mathematical and computer science-related courses like Calculus I/II, 
                    Object-Oriented Programming I/II, Discrete Mathematics, and will continue next semester 
                    when I take Applied Probability and Statistics I. I initially considered purchasing an 
                    iPad for school because of the array of YouTube videos I watched featuring an iPad or 
                    tablet of some kind for notes and its practicality. But, on the first day of class, I 
                    needed to employ the hypothetico-deductive method of science. This method of note-taking 
                    works for others, but will I be successful with such?   
                </p>

                <p class="intro-text">
                    So, over that first semester, I experimented with this approach for each of my classes. 
                    The results of the experiment would be based on how well I did in each of these courses, 
                    as well as my level of comprehension I believe I had. Then, in my second semester, I 
                    implemented the similar approach that I had used for the previous semester, except I 
                    improved on it by taking better notes; by better, I mean less verbatim, and a clearer 
                    picture of my understanding. In conclusion, taking notes on my iPad helped a ton. I 
                    did such for the aforementioned courses, and it made me a better student. I wouldn’t 
                    say that my time within SGC prepared me to employ it, but it definitely gave me the 
                    bigger picture of the hypothetico-deductive method of science. 
                </p>

                <p class="intro-text">
                    There were many opportunities throughout my time in the SGC program where I’ve had the 
                    opportunity to work with my peers, and it has definitely enhanced my learning! I sat 
                    with two of my friends that I met at orientation, and they also happened to live in 
                    the same building as I for the fall and spring semesters. Moreover, the wonderful 
                    realization of this was that we were all computer science majors. That we were all 
                    of similar majors within the same building meant collaboration was done with ease. 
                    Moreover, as these friends were more ahead in the major than I, to seek help wasn’t 
                    an issue at all. And, because of Scholars and their living-learning practices, I 
                    was able to create, what I hope, two long-lasting friendships. 
                </p>

                <p class="intro-text">
                    I’ve encountered several news-related items outside of the SGC classroom that I’ve 
                    found particularly notable. And throughout this semester, I stumbled upon an episode 
                    of the Lex Fridman Podcast on Spotify featuring Dr. Bjørn Lomborg. In one of his 
                    introductory statements, he argues that most of the mass media act like fear-mongers, 
                    projecting the ideas that only enable media consumers to be alarmed of our current 
                    climate state, specifically too alarmed. Lomborg states that addressing climate 
                    risks like the abundance of carbon dioxide is an “incredibly difficult and 
                    slightly inefficient way of trying to help [us] in the future”. Rather, there 
                    should be action taken on a local level, like proper zoning laws and regulations 
                    on where one can and cannot build homes (like in flash flood areas). And after 
                    being in SGC for some time, I’d have to agree with some aspects of this argument. 
                </p>

                <p class="intro-text">
                    I recall reading an article published by the Yale Climate Connections in class that 
                    detailed the developed “real estate bubble” throughout states in the United States 
                    like Florida, Louisiana, and California. And, this bubble was caused by the 
                    unreasonable housing development in risky places — notice how Florida and Louisiana 
                    are two states vulnerable to the impacts of hurricanes. And so, SGC has led me to 
                    agree with Lomborg, while had I not been in SGC, I’d keep my original stance.
                </p>

                <p class="intro-text">
                    I think I’ve contributed greatly to SGC. Throughout colloquiums, particularly this 
                    semester, but also in previous semesters, I've been somewhat outspoken. And in a 
                    classroom that doesn’t feature as many questions from students as it should, I 
                    believe I’ve left a mark that has also caused my peers to think. However, I think 
                    my greatest contribution to SGC has come in the form of being a peer mentor to 
                    freshmen to the program. I was a mentee last semester, and I felt as if my peer 
                    mentor helped in some ways. So, I wanted to return the favor, instead to newcomers 
                    to the program, by becoming a peer mentor. I served as, for lack of better word, 
                    a guide for them, answering their questions, getting them more involved with the 
                    amenities on campus, and at least attempting to help them become more comfortable 
                    as a student in a community of over 40,000 students!
                </p>

                <p class="intro-text">
                    I believe that being in Scholars hasn’t directly led to any of my perspectives on 
                    issues being changed. I’d like to add that throughout the colloquiums thus far, 
                    its content has been rather passive and conforms to all of my beliefs. I believe 
                    that a wonderful addition to colloquium would be a “debate day”, where groups are 
                    created among students and assigned ideals along the full spectrum of climate 
                    activism. Each group will have to conduct research supporting their ideals, and 
                    then write about a single counterargument. At the end, each group will present 
                    their research, and debate will ensue. This would allow for a satellite view of 
                    the topic of global change within colloquium and may achieve what Scholars intended 
                    to allow for: diversity of thought.
                </p>

                <p class="intro-text">
                    My experience in Scholars so far has been okay, and I’ve learned a lot over the past 
                    three semesters. It has caused me to be even a bit more proactive in the fight 
                    against climate change. As I am a STEM major, I know that I’ll continue to use 
                    the hypothetico-deductive method of science from now on; thus, I plan on taking 
                    what I’ve learned from that short period of instruction to my later semesters. 
                    Moreover, I’ve been skeptical about pursuing graduate studies; if I do though, 
                    hat’s another area I’ll apply the method, but also what I’ve learned about 
                    scientific and technical writing. And of course, one significant lesson that 
                    I’ve learned from SGC is that it’s never too late to make a difference in 
                    the world — it’s why despite negative public opinion, I’ll be alert to 
                    growing concerns of the state of our planet Earth.
