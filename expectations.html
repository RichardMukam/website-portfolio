                My Initial Thoughts, and The Realities, of My First Semester in College
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="intro-div">
            <div id="intro">
                <p class="intro-text">
                    I can confidently say that my first semester at the University of Maryland, 
                    College Park — one of several dream colleges of mine — has been an actual roller coaster! I recall those many days back at home 
                    when I’d watch television shows and movies featuring the idolization of college. There were minimal depictions of stressed students. 
                    The idea of going to a frat party late at night, or parties in general, was heavily emphasized. That I’d have time to have fun and be free. 
                    In retrospect, it was all wrong. University life is strenuous, and that may be perceived as an understatement. I had no 8AMs, so I wasn’t, essentially, suffering. But, I really was. 
                </p>
                <p class="intro-text">
                    Not even a month into the semester, I got ill. Initially, I thought it was ‘frat flu’, the ‘freshman 
                    flu’, or even the coronavirus! It inhibited tons of what I’d grown accustomed to — being lively at 
                    LaPlata Beach, binging shows with friends, participating in group study sessions with friends, and 
                    being active. It was terrible, and I tried every medicine possible to get over it: Benadryl, DayQuil,
                    Neo-synephrine, and cough drops — didn’t work. Natural remedies? All to no avail. I waited a week to 
                    speak with my doctor, and he advised me to take Claritin. I went to the University Health Center, but they didn’t have the 
                    name-brand version, so I got a knockoff instead — it worked! A week later, the illness said, “I’m back!” 
                    In the end, it was neither of the ‘sicknesses’ I thought, but rather allergies, but it was petrifying — my first two months were a nightmare. 
                </p>
            
                <p class="intro-text">
                    I love math — that’s one thing you should probably know about me. If I could describe my love for 
                    mathematics even further, I wish to double major in computer science (an already math-heavy major) 
                    and mathematics. The exhilaration felt once a lengthy derivative is solved, or a complex integral, 
                    that takes up an entire 8.5 x 11-inch college-ruled paper, brings a long-lasting smile to my face. 
                </p>

                <p class="intro-text">
                    I decided to take MATH 140, Calculus I, and to be honest, I had mixed feelings. I loved it when I 
                    got ‘wins’ and disliked it when I took several losses. Dr. Chadwick, my professor, was friendly and
                    easy to speak with. Through various topics though, he tended to skip processes, expecting us the 
                    students to understand what he did, which wasn’t pleasant. Life’s biggest question is “why?”, 
                    because you can reply to any question with such, and I follow this ‘philosophy’, per se. 
                    Nonetheless, he’d occasionally move swiftly with topics, which I disliked, and ever so often 
                    we’d run out of class time to explore a topic that’d be on the homework due the next day. The 
                    worksheets given in our discussions irked me the most though: its contents were ten times more 
                    difficult than what we had actually learned! I could never finish on time too; it was why, though 
                    discouraged, I resorted to using a calculator as an aid, up until mid-October though. A classmate 
                    invited me to sit in the back with his other peers; they all worked together, so they could 
                    always complete the work: simply divide and conquer. I didn’t expect a University course to be 
                    such a nuisance, perhaps more thorough and ‘fun’, but I got just that.
                </p>

                <p class="intro-text">
                    Aside from math, I love the field of computer science. As a required course for my major, I took 
                    CMSC 131, or Object-Oriented Programming I, which was basically an introduction to Java. I enjoyed 
                    the contents. The professor, Nelson, was lovely — and funny! On the first day of class, Nelson told 
                    us that we shouldn’t fear asking any questions, and he’d condemn those who’d laugh at one’s question. 
                    This mere statement changed my initial thoughts on a university course. It made me understand that 
                    some professors do care for their students! It also made me understand that even in lectures filled 
                    to the brim, your voice may still be heard. The projects were strenuous at times, but I majored in 
                    computer science knowing the path wouldn’t be easy — and this was just one of many computer science 
                    courses I’d take. I learned tons of invaluable information, and just after this one semester, I can 
                    see my goal of becoming a software engineer crawl closer and closer to me.
                </p>

                <p class="intro-text">
                    Speaking of computer science, I took INST 204, which serves as an introduction to the prevalent 
                    algorithmic bias issue that affects real people and communities constantly.I wish to pursue a 
                    machine learning specialization in computer science, so it was a great start. 
                    There were weekly quizzes on the assigned readings we’d discuss in class, so you’d think you 
                    couldn’t fail, but man did those quizzes get exponentially onerous. Dr. Greene is honestly a 
                    caring professor, and his lectures were captivating. One is given a myriad of courses to register 
                    for, so I’m glad I loved it as much as I thought I would.
                </p>
                
                    
                <p class="intro-text">
                    Learning about the beginnings of America to the Civil War while in my HIST 200 was splendid. 
                    The curriculum in high school definitely hid tons of information from us students, so I’m 
                    grateful I had the opportunity to take the course with Dr. Chiles. His delivery of the contents 
                    was extravagant, filled with energy and enthusiasm: just what I expected from a University 
                    lecturer. The structure of the class was like gold too: a discussion post and reply per lecture, 
                    followed by readings to be read prior to our discussion on Friday. Simple. It felt professional, 
                    and it modeled class discussions I’d have in high school.
                </p>

                <p class="intro-text">
                    I enjoy several portions of science, though I dislike learning about biology and chemistry. 
                    Thus, I was partially excited to learn about environmental science and global change with CPSG100. 
                    I’m semi-passionate now about environmental sustainability, but I had my stage, and it was exciting. 
                    The out-of-classroom experiences that we’d had thus far were expected. For my first excursion, 
                    I had the opportunity to go to the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center in Edgewater, Maryland. 
                    I went alongside my peers and professors, and I got to do a myriad of things: take samples of fish, 
                    clean the outer shell of oysters, and take a hike! I definitely didn’t expect this class to cover 
                    the anatomy of a scientific paper, and how to create a scientific paper — so that’s pretty cool! 
                    As for topics that we haven’t covered but I expected, I was looking forward to us delving into 
                    environmental sustainability research papers. It’s imperative that students (who are of the younger, 
                    upcoming generation), as well as every other inhabitant of the Earth, knows that the protection of 
                    our environment should be of our greatest concern. I recall reading portions of the United Nation’s 
                    Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Sixth Assessment Report, and it influenced me heavily. 
                    But, it’s not just me that needs to be influenced — it’s everybody else too.
                </p>

                <p class="intro-text">
                    Now that this first semester is in the books, I reminisce of those days when I wanted to speak with nobody 
                    but myself, a mirror of my days as a senior in high school. The hurt, sorrow, and hopelessness in my heart. 
                    The questions that rested on my mind. Do I really have the potential to be great? Should I quit? 
                    How can I stand out with tons of talent around campus? Do I even deserve to be at UMD? There were 
                    many highlights throughout the semester: meeting lovely friends, enjoying football and basketball 
                    games, and the late nights with friends! It was incredible — certainly unforgettable. My best advice to future SGC students would be 
                    to become accustomed to the life of a college student early. I’d say that they should know there will 
                    be extreme lows, times when one wishes to give up — yes, it’s cliche to say, albeit certainly true. 
                    I’d say to students to find their motivation. What drives one to continue being great? Lastly, 
                    I’d remind them that out of the thousands of applicants, Maryland chose them.
