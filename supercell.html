                    Question 1: Performance art multimedia performances like this one are a radically different approach 
                    to conveying the issues and concerns of global climate change compared to more traditional 
                    science or news media venues. What do you think about this performance? In what way was its 
                    messaging helpful compared to traditional approaches? In what ways might it be less helpful? 
                </p>
                <p class="intro-text">
                    The performance that I had witnessed was truly mesmerizing! The emotion expressed by each of the 
                    cast members (dancers) was incredible. I was genuinely on the edge of my seat throughout it all. 
                    Moreover, I had learned that about 50% of their performance was improv. I spoke with one of the 
                    performers after the show ended, and he specifically told me that during his monologue, when he 
                    said “what are you writing?; I’m talking to you.”, he was referring to me. In fact, as soon as 
                    he had said “I’m talking to you”, I looked up from my notebook and there he was, staring deep 
                    into my eyes. I was frightened, but was ultimately astonished by how engaged they had made the 
                    audience. What you’re doing is not important, listen to what I’m saying, I thought. It was 
                    difficult to connect their dancing with climate change, but their dialogues were engaging in a 
                    way that was different than ordinary messaging. The passion by statements such as “I’m obsessed 
                    with oil” and “I’m obsessed with equity”: all statements that are nice, but obsession should be 
                    about sustainability and saving the world. The way the performer expressed those statements was 
                    touching. The messaging was helpful in that it was made relevant to our own lives and how we are 
                    obsessed with the wrong things. The messaging might’ve been less helpful in that the dancing I 
                    feel was a not relevant I feel. Perhaps the goal was for us, the audience, to be more engaged 
                    with the dancing than the monologues and dialogues.  
                </p>
            
                <p class="intro-text">
                    Question 2: How did you feel about this piece? Did it affect you in any way? Did it seem to affect 
                    others in the audience? What were your observations?
                </p>

                <p class="intro-text">
                    I felt like this piece was well crafted. The piece was engaging, and the underlying message was 
                    somewhat decipherable. I definitely do believe that it has affected me. The line that really stuck 
                    with me was the “I’m talking about you” line. I feel like we all focus on the wrong things in life, 
                    while people who are working toward changing our world for the better are ignored or put to the 
                    side. The dialogue and monologue definitely impacted me more than what I could get from the 
                    dancing, but then again it was the first dancing performance I’ve been to: thus, I didn’t entirely 
                    know what to expect. I definitely think that this piece affected others in the audience as well. 
                    After the performance, I overheard a few people including those I came with, who spoke of how 
                    impacted they were from the piece,  
                </p>

                <p class="intro-text">
                    Question 3: Was there anything in this performance which you felt was factually incorrect or that might 
                    otherwise impair or otherwise hinder the understanding of or response to global climate change? 
                    If so, what was it?
                </p>

                <p class="intro-text">
                    I do not believe that anything presented in the performance was factually incorrect. The exclamation 
                    and emphasis that the presenters had made during their speaking parts I felt were important: there 
                    needs to be great emphasis on our entire response to global climate change. The times when the 
                    performers would reminisce about sunny days to now limited rain and dying roses: it was abundantly 
                    clear what the message of the performance was.
                </p>

                <p class="intro-text">
                    Question 4: How broad an audience do you think this work would appeal to, and why?
                </p>

                <p class="intro-text">
                    I’d say that this work would be tailored to students more than any other group. As we are young, 
                    there’s much to be obsessed about. And, within the piece, obsession is addressed. We are obsessed 
                    with our Starbucks drinks of which we consume daily. We’re obsessed with posting on social media. 
                    It was difficult to see any other audience the performers were attempting to appeal to than 
                    students, or adolescents and young adults if you will.
                </p>

                <p class="intro-text">
                    Question 5: During the Q&A, did you hear anything from the creators or the audience that made you rethink the performance? If so, what was it?
                </p>

                <p class="intro-text">
                    As I had mentioned before, I had no idea that the performance wasn’t entirely scripted: I thought 
                    it was! There were a few times during the performance when the performers would shout things 
                    particular to an audience member. But, it shocked me to hear that improv was rooted in their 
                    performance, as well as slowdanger as a whole. I also learned that this show was two years in the 
                    making, which made me understand why the choreography was so spot on. Lastly, even before beginning 
                    production for Supercell, the performers had known each other personally. I’m sure that with this, 
                    the performers were able to take their production to new heights.
