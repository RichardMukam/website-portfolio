                    In the Spring 2023 academic semester, I had the incredible opportunity to work as a software engineer 
                    in Hack4Impact-UMD, a student organization focused on empowering students to create social good 
                    through its partnerships with local non-profit organizations. I worked with a team of twelve other 
                    students consisting of engineers, designers, technical leads, and product managers of varying class 
                    standings to work on the completion of a website for a non-profit student organization Combating 
                    Overdoses in Rural Areas (CORA). As can be inferred, the non-profit works toward educating people 
                    in the community and beyond the issue of drug overdoses nationwide. Moreover, they share prevention 
                    tactics, train individuals with how to administer naloxone in the event of an overdose incident, 
                    and news on policy and legislative enactments pertaining to drug overdoses. We met both in-person 
                    and online, with meetings held every week, and communicated offline using Slack. I contributed to 
                    the project while balancing my coursework, as our project timeline went from the start of the Spring 
                    2023 semester to the end — about 16 weeks.

                    I applied to join Hack4Impact-UMD before my freshman year began at the University of Maryland. After 
                    my first semester as a member in the organization, I had the opportunity to join a project team and 
                    make real contributions to my community, like with my work at CORA. My listed site supervisor, Nelson 
                    Padua-Perez, was the advisor of Hack4Impact-UMD. I’ve been enrolled in classes taught by him, so I 
                    did know him prior to beginning my work. I loved my experience as a software engineer working with 
                    my incredible team on our product to CORA. And, my advice for identifying a practicum site advisor 
                    would be to speak up. The University has a wide range of practicum-worthy opportunities, and its 
                    imperative one takes it upon themselves to seize the opportunity and be proactive.

                    I performed several tasks within my team. Again, the website we were developing was near completion: 
                    development began in Fall 2021. The tasks that were left weren’t as difficult in comparison with what 
                    the tasks would’ve been for an engineer the semester prior. One of my goals was to make the website 
                    responsive on mobile devices. At the time, the website wasn’t easily accessible on phones and tablets 
                    — it was only functional on products of larger screen sizes. And, considering that many individuals 
                    have phones, it was imperative that I carry out my task successfully. I worked with React and CSS to 
                    achieve my goal, and I was successful. Moreover, there were a few bug fixes that had to be addressed. 
                    For example, clicking on a certain hyperlink wouldn’t open a new window to the intended page — I 
                    fixed that on a few pages.

                    The field of computer science is vast, and there are many subfields like software engineering. If 
                    there’s one thing I learned from this experience, it is that collaboration is nearly essential in the 
                    field. The projects one may embark on more other than not require great critical thinking skills 
                    and the ability to solve problems efficiently. In my experience, I gained experience with solving 
                    complex problems and exactly why my computer performed the way it did with my code. I found this 
                    experience extremely valuable to me, both personally and professionally. It brings me great joy 
                    when I have the opportunity to impact lives, like through the work I did within the high school’s 
                    environmental club (found on the homepage of my portfolio) and now this! And so much so that I plan 
                    on continuing my involvement in volunteer opportunities after graduation: activities that allow me 
                    to connect and impact my community. Whether that be remaining connected to Hack4Impact-UMD, the 
                    national Hack4Impact organization, or doing my own thing remains a mystery, but this experience 
                    allowed me to once again confirm with myself that I love doing impactful work.
